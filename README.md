# SpecFlow NUnit C# Project

This repository contains a SpecFlow NUnit C# project that demonstrates how to write and run behavior-driven development (BDD) tests using SpecFlow and NUnit. The project serves as a starting point for developing and executing BDD tests in a .NET environment.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that the following software is installed on your machine:

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 3.1 or higher)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (optional, but recommended)

## Getting Started

To get started with the SpecFlow NUnit C# project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RohanKarimi/BankAccountApiTest-reports-SpecFlowNUnit.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio.

3. Build the solution to restore NuGet packages and compile the code.

4. Open the "Test Explorer" window in your IDE to view and run the SpecFlow scenarios.

5. To execute the SpecFlow tests, right-click on the desired test(s) in the "Test Explorer" and choose "Run Selected Tests" or use the keyboard shortcut.

6. Monitor the test execution progress and review the test results in the "Test Explorer" window.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows a typical C# solution layout. Here's an overview of the key folders and files:

- `Specs`: Contains the SpecFlow feature files (`*.feature`) that define the behavior scenarios.
- `Steps`: Contains the step definition files (`*Steps.cs`) that map the steps in the feature files to the corresponding test code.
- `Helpers`: Contains any helper classes or methods that assist in the test execution.
- `Tests`: Contains the NUnit test classes (`*Tests.cs`) that implement the test logic.
- `appsettings.json`: Configuration file for any project-specific settings.

## Writing Tests

To write new tests or modify existing ones, follow these guidelines:

1. Create a new feature file in the `Specs` folder or modify an existing one.

2. Define your feature and scenarios using the [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/).

3. Save the feature file, and SpecFlow will generate corresponding step definition skeletons.

4. Implement the step definitions in the `Steps` folder by writing the necessary C# code to execute the test steps.

5. Create or modify the NUnit test classes in the `Tests` folder to orchestrate the steps and perform assertions.

6. Use the various NUnit attributes (e.g., `[Test]`, `[TestCase]`) to mark your test methods.

7. Run the tests using the Test Explorer or via the command line using `dotnet test`.

## Customizing the Project

You can customize the project according to your requirements by doing the following:

- Install additional NuGet packages for additional functionality or libraries.
- Modify the project settings in `appsettings.json` to suit your needs.
- Update the project structure to follow your preferred organization.
